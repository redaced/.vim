This is my good old Vim setup, that has evolved over the years. I don't usually clone this repo manually -- installation is handled by the dotfiles installer.

TO INSTALL:

Clone repo to ~/.vim (fork first if you'd like)

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

    vim +PlugInstall +qa

FEATURES

* Many UI/workflow enhancements
* Understandable file structure
* Language support
+ Much more
